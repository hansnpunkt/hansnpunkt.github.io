I am interested in the material properties of our world and how we can measure them. I like building sensors, extracting, visualizing and interpreting data.

A short history of everything
======
I am a computer scientist and applied geoscientist. In Germany, I studied marine geochemistry in Bremen and applied geosciences in Aachen. After moving to Vancouver with my wife in 2013, I worked as a geophysicist all over western Canada for more than 3 years. In 2017, I decided to learn the tools that I had used for so long in the past properly and went to the University of British Columbia to study computer science. 		
As a geochemist, I have been on expeditions to the tropical waters of the South Pacific.  
As a geophysicst, I lead field crews to investigate the subsoil of western Canada.  
As a computer scientist, I built a universal testing machine and estimated the material properties of sports bras.  
I like reading books about the simple life, playing video games and chasing after my kids.

In this project we explore how eye movements relate to dynamic visual acuity (DVA) of the UBC varsity baseball team.


Why is dynamic visual acuity important?
------
Accurate vision is important to successfully navigate our environment. We rely on clear visual input to make out the line number on an apporaching bus or to read a street sign when walking to get ice cream. In dynamic contexts, such as in ball sports, we rely on accurate dynamic visual acuity (DVA) to successfully interact with moving objects in our surrounding. DVA describes our ability to resolve fine details in a moving object. DVA has been shown to be related to the level of expertise in many ball sports --- more expert athletes appear to be able to resolve more spatial details on moving objects, such as the seams on a pitched baseball. Is this perceptual advantage linked to how athletes move their eyes?

Eye movement quality is related to DVA performance
------
We tested DVA of 23 UBC varsity baseball players while simultaneously recording their eye movements. Players had to report the gap location (top/bottom, left/right) of a quickly moving Landolt-C ring. We were able to link players' eye movemets to perceptual performance: minimizing eye position error, tracking the moving ring smoothly, and avoiding backward saccades during tracking was associated with higher dynamic visual acuity. So keep your eyes on the ball or at least get them very close to it at least once. <br>
